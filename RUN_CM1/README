job.input - specify job details. these settings refer to specific job in the series, so the total time of the simulation is run_time*num_files
INPUT - the input files required for CM1 simulation are contained here. input_sounding_* are not used, but are here for convenience. Copy the one you want to input_sounding.
cm1run - master script.
	1. loads parameters from job.input and determines directories specified by job name in job.input.
	2. copies the necessary files from INPUT and prepares  namelist.inputXX files for restarts (modifies irst,rstnum,run_time,rstfrq)
	3. creates a recursive run script cm1.exe.run
	4. runs cm1.exe.run that iterates through namelist.inputXX files

HOW TO USE:
1. edit  JOB.INPUT,
2. prepare/select input_sounding and input_grid in /INPUT
3. run the simulation with: ./cm1run
